# Natural Language Processing
### Algorithms & Experimentation With Python & SpaCy

This is a collection of NLP algorithms implemented in python with the SpaCy library. 

### Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install SpaCy.

```bash
pip install -U spacy
```

### Intention
This collection is currently being built up by UCD Computer Science student Daniel Gallagher.
The purpose is to improve understanding of natural language processing techniques.
